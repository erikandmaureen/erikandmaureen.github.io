					<b>Dear friends and family,</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					We’ve registered…finally. After a few thousand trips to Younkers and BB&B (Bed Bath and Beyond) spent wandering through the gigantic stores and arguments over towels (plush for the win), we actually have a list! By the end of our wish list creation marathon, we accumulated a good amount of items. If you notice something on our list that you have creatively learned to do without, please give us your feedback – we are still rookies. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We love all of you deeply (except Jason Richter), and feel blessed that you would want to honor us with gifts as we begin our lives together. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Having you here with us to celebrate means more to us than salad spinners or cheese knives, we promise! Whatever you gift, we’ll love and cherish. 
				</p>
